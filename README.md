- Built the backend with Java Spring Boot, while using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.
- Producer-Consumer model by single code base with Spring's active profiles
	* Used SQS as queue. 
	* Used Redis as a Message broker to notify the test result from consumer to producer.
	* Used WebSocket to notify the user upon completion of testing.
- Used a thread pool to process group tests simultaneously.
- Used mail service to send email notifications to users upon test failures.
